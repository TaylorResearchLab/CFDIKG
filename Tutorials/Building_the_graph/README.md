# Steps for building Petagraph

## Petagraph uses the UMLS Knowledge graph as it's base graph. We then ingest ontologies and datasets on top of this graph.


## 1. Human - Mouse Ortholog Relationships
### Navigate to [HGNC's Ortholog Prediction Tool](https://www.genenames.org/tools/hcop/), scroll to the bottom and under 'Bulk Downloads' select  'Mouse' from the first drop down menu option and '15 column' from the second drop down menu option. Download this dataset.
